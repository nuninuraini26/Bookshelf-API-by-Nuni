This project is created to fulfill the final assignment of Dicoding back-end class for beginner program. 
I made it so proud to myself and encouraged me to take a baby-step to be a full-stack javascript developer.


This API is developed in Node.js environtment using hapi framework and eslint to make my code writen consistently. 
It is tested all pass by compiled postman testing file provided by Dicoding.
None change or new version built so it can be called as really first version of my work.
